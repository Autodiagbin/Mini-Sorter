# Mini sorter

This is a experiment to use python as a tool for my actual job.
This tool allow you to sort your files by folders using a a UI.

## RoadMap

A lot of things has to be done for that little practice program.

 - [x] Create the program and the main object
 - [x] Create a little database using a JSON file 
 - [x] Create the layout of the UI
 - [x] Create the link between the sorter app and the UI
 - [ ] Customize the UI
 - [ ] Save the last Settings in the sorter
 - [ ] Log every actions to prevent any missing files after using it
